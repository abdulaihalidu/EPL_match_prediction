Introduction: 
Football, better known as soccer in the US and Canada, is arguably the most popular sport in the world. It thus, necessitates the need to better understand the game by making some analysis of the game to explore more insights. In this task, I make some analysis of the EPL and subsequently create an ML model that predicts the outcome of a football match (win, draw, or lose by the home team).
I was provided with the European Soccer Dataset for this task, which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer
